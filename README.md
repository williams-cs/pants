# pants

Pants is a parser combinator library for Typescript.

## documentation

[Typedoc documentation can be found here](https://williams-cs.github.io/pants/)

## installing dependencies and building

We supply a `Makefile` with Pants to make working with this library easy. To install dependencies and build, run:

```
$ make
```

in the Pants repository directory.

If you don't want to use the `Makefile`, you can also run `npm` commands directly.

To install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

To build:

```
$ npm run build
```

## TypeScript and TypeDoc versions

Pants is currently developed and tested with TypeScript 4.2.3 and TypeDoc 0.20.34.

## running tests

Run:

```
$ make test
```
